# Odin Project Rock Paper Scissors Project

## Overview:

The task given was to implement a simple console based Rock, Paper, Scissors
game which would play for five rounds, with each round allowing the user to
enter a choice of either Rock, Paper or scissors. The computer would also makes
it choice and score would be kept over the course of the five rounds and be
displayed at the end.

## Challanges:

This project was relatively easy, however I did run into some issues when trying
to test the diffrent combinations of choices as I had not initally realised that
the random computer output was changing everytime I called the function in the
`console.log()`. Once I came to this realisation it became much easier to
understand what was happening.
